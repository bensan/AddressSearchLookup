# Address Search Lookup

This is a simple Lightning Web Component that allows you to search for an address and then populate the address fields on a record. It uses the Google Maps Validation API to validate the address that was input by the user. If the address is valid, it will populate the address fields on an Account standard compound address fields.

This component can be useful if the location information is required to be validated by a third party service because your business needs to ship something to the Account location.
